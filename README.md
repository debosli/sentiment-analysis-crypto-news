# Crypto News Sentiment Analysis

This project is focused on analyzing cryptocurrency news and extracting sentiment from the articles. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, we process the news data, clean it, and perform sentiment analysis to understand the overall tone of the articles (positive, negative, or neutral). 

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

- Clean and preprocess news text data.
- Extract sentiment-related features like polarity and subjectivity.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualize trends in cryptocurrency news.
- Provide a foundation for further analysis or predictive modeling based on news sentiment.

## Technologies Used

- **Python Libraries**:
  - `pandas` – Data manipulation and analysis
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Data visualization
  - `nltk` – Natural language processing (NLP)
  - `sklearn` – Machine learning (for splitting data)
  
- **NLP Techniques**:
  - Tokenization
  - Lemmatization
  - Sentiment extraction

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: 
    - The text is cleaned by removing punctuation, stopwords, and unnecessary characters.
    - Words are lemmatized to ensure that they are in their root form.

- **Sentiment Extraction**:
    - Sentiment classes (positive, negative, neutral) and sentiment polarity (scale from -1 to 1) are extracted from the articles.
    - The project handles sentiment data and processes it into usable formats for analysis.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cryptonews-sentiment-analysis.git
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download any necessary datasets (like the `cryptonews.csv`).

## Usage

1. **Data Loading**: 
    - The data is loaded from a CSV file containing cryptocurrency news articles.
  
2. **Preprocessing**: 
    - The preprocessing function cleans the text by:
      - Lowercasing the text
      - Removing punctuation and stopwords
      - Lemmatizing words
    
3. **Sentiment Extraction**: 
    - The `extract_sentiment_info` function parse sentiment data, extracting classes (positive/negative/neutral), polarity, and subjectivity.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
    - Various visualizations and insights are generated to help understand the data trends.

## Example

The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook with a series of steps:

```python
# Load the data
df = pd.read_csv('cryptonews.csv')

# Preprocess the text
df['processed_text'] = df['text'].apply(preprocess_text)

# Extract sentiment features
df[['class', 'polarity', 'subjectivity']] = df['sentiment'].apply(lambda x: pd.Series(extract_sentiment_info(x)))
```

You can follow the notebook to analyze and visualize sentiment trends.
